# Emotion-Detection
### This project is a web-based emotion detection system using DeepFace for emotion analysis. Users can capture live images or upload an image, detect emotions, and receive remedies based on the detected emotion. The system also maintains an emotion frequency heatmap and suggests music recommendations.
